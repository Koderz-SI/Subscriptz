<b>About Project:</b>
1) Anyone can add extra subscriptions that they would not need. They can swap them with others that would use them.
2) We are having a explore page where users can check the available subscriptions.
3) On Add page anyone can add their subscriptions.
4) At My Subscriptz user can check out the subscriptions which they have claimed.
